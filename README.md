# For development

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal which will start a local http
server on port 8080. After that, you can open <http://localhost:8080> in
your browser and any code changes will update in real time (you might have to refresh).

NOTE: Use `Ctrl + F5` instead of `F5` as it will force the cache to be ignored, which will
prevent you from seeing the old version
